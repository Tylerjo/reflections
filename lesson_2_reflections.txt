When you create a repository, you're just creating something to hold
your commits. You have made no commits at this point.
It's important, because you need something to commit to. This will track
all the data for this project and provide you with logs etc.

The staging area is an intermediate between the working directory and the repository.
So if I were to want something in my repo that I had in my working directory,
I would move it into my staging area, then commit it to my repository. 
This would work with multiple files. I can choose how many I want to commit to
the repository. It offers value, because I have control over what I want to move to the repo.
If I want to make one logical change to my program, I can choose 2 files that make that one logical change. If my entire project has to be committed, then it's possible that I may have many changes in one commit. This isn't great practice.
