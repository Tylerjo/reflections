I would want to use a remote repository when I know I'm going to be
working from multiple machines or if I have or want other people working 
on a project.

Having git automatically pull changes from a remote would be a pain in the ass.
I want to complete control over what I'm working on, and having commits starting
to show up in my log would be annoying.

A fork is when I copy a remote repository from someone's Github account to my
account. This is will not be in my local repository until I pull it.
